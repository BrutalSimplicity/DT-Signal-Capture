DT9816 Real-time Signal Capture

This was a project for an embedded course I took at Univerity of Texas-Arlington. The original project was to write a parallel C++ program and capture signals from the DT9816 device on another computer and write them to disk. I don't think anyone believe it coudld be done in C#. So I gave it a try, and the result was this neat little app and libraries.

Pictures are included in one of the directories. Along with the word document convert detailing the process.

*TODO*
- Add pics to readme
- Move some info from word doc to a project page
- Breakout the libraries into their own nifty packages
